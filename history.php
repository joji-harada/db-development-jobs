            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Database is a data structure that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated. In
                1960, Charles W. Bachman was known for his work in the early development of database management systems
                and he designed the integrated database system that is the “first” database management system. He is the
                “father of database” who received the award for 1973 for creating the first database management system.
                In the mid -1960s, many corporations used to data in file-processing systems, but it was difficult to
                manage the data. Database technology resolved these problems by organizational database. In 1970, Edgar
                Codd solved his theories of data arrangement based on mathematical set theory. He is the creator of the
                relational databases model known as Relational Databases Management Systems. Relational database refers
                to a database that stores data by using rows and columns in a structured format. Nowadays, Many
                companies used to Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). It is widely used by enterprises and
                software developers to store large amount of complex data. The Relational Database Management Systems
                have both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>It is easy to use</li>
                <li>It is secured in nature</li>
                <li>The data manipulation can be done</li>
                <li>It limits redundancy and replication of the data</li>
                <li>It provides multiple interfaces.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The disadvantages are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Software is expensive</li>
                <li>It requires skilled human resources to implement</li>
                <li>It is difficult to recover the lost data</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In the 1980s, the object-oriented DBMS develops. Object-oriented DBMS is a DBMS as used in
                object-oriented programing. It
                is used to support engineering applications and not have functions to business information
                applications.In 2000, databases used as internet technology.</p>
            <p>Database administration is an activity done by database administrator by using specialized software to
                store and organize data. It plays a main role in any organization that is dependent on one or more
                database. A database administration has responsible for the following tasks. Some of these are database
                security, Database Tuning, Backup and recovery and producing reports from queries. These shows that the
                database administration function requires technical training and years of experience. There are three
                types of database administration.First, System DBAs which activities are on the physical aspects of
                database administration. Second, Development DBAs which focuses on the logical and development aspects
                of database administration and finally application DBAs which manage all the application component that
                connect with the database. Database administrators are employees who maintains database and use
                specialized software to store and organize data.</p>
